# First idea

Run the request through autopilot and explain the output. This was my first try using
gpt-4 API. I decided to give autopilot 3 tries to write this task. The first try was
adequate for solving the first challenge. The 2nd one was valid but more complex and 
was pushing the limits of a proof of concept. The 3rd one was unusable, only providing
text output.

# 2nd idea

After this I considered if I could get this running inside a container using
devcontainer.json but my attempts at getting k0s or kind working in a docker provider
did not work. This turned out to be non-trivial and I settled on running on kind.

The helm and python steps were accomplished with no difficulty. The python chatlog with
chatgpt-4 is included in this directory. The python script data validation could be 
improved but is adequate and not overly long.

# Ran out of time

I burned too much time on my second idea and did not have time to complete challenges 5-9.

GPT: What would you like me to do?
You: write for me a prompt to instruct chatgpt-4 how to Write a Kubernetes StatefulSet to run
The one container of our choosing, using persistent volume claims,
resource requests and resource limits.

Making prompt better...

## Better prompt: ##
Design a detailed guide for an AI chatbot, specifically the future ChatGPT-4 model, on creating a Kubernetes StatefulSet. The guide should comprehensively describe the creation of a StatefulSet, the purpose of these in maintaining stateful applications in Kubernetes, details to specify for pod management, and the role of Volumes for persistent storage. The prompt must be composed in specifics, addressing every mentionable nuance that an AI would need for accurate understanding and subsequent implementation.

## ChatGPT Responded ##
```

First, I will create the README.md file by calling the `file_open_for_writing('README.md')` function. This file will act as the guide for the ChatGPT-4 model.

Next, I will begin drafting the guide by providing a comprehensive introduction to Kubernetes StatefulSets. I will explain that a StatefulSet is a Kubernetes object that is used to manage stateful applications. It manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

Following the introduction, I will describe in detail how to create a StatefulSet in Kubernetes. I will elaborate that users must first define a .yaml file for the StatefulSet configuration.

Then, I will delve into the specifics of pod management in StatefulSets. I will point out that StatefulSets have a unique identity, that these identities are based on a sticky, stable network identity and that even if a StatefulSet’s Pod is rescheduled, its network ID will not change.

After detailing pod management, I will discuss the role of Volumes in Kubernetes for persistent storage. I will note that Kubernetes Volumes enables data to survive container restarts, but these disappear when the Pod is deleted. However, the volume for each Pod is created using the pod name, which is consistent and based on the replica’s ordinal, and when a Pod is rescheduled, it's possible to resume from the same state, using persistent volume.

Next, I will close the guide by providing cautionary points that users need to be aware of when working with StatefulSets. These points will include detailed information about deletion and scaling.

Finally, I will finish the project by calling `project_finished(true)`.
